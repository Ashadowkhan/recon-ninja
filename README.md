# recon-ninja

The tool is a GitHub repository that provides a recon tool that lets you upload your domain discovery through an upload option. The tool utilizes HTTPX, which is a tool that scans for alive domains. The tool also has an integrated MongoDB Atlas database, which is a cloud-based database that allows the tool to store the recon data.

Users can interact with the tool through a user interface (UI) that provides a searchable view of the uploaded subdomains. The UI also distinguishes title cname and provides a search option to easily navigate through the uploaded data of subdomains.

Additionally, the tool provides the ability to run Nuclei in the backend via the UI. Nuclei is a tool that is used for vulnerability scanning and is commonly used in conjunction with other reconnaissance tools. Users can receive notifications via Discord when the Nuclei scan is complete.

Overall, your tool provides an efficient and effective way to gather and store recon data, as well as easily search and navigate through the collected data via a user-friendly UI. The integration of Nuclei and Discord notifications also adds value to the tool by providing additional scanning capabilities and easy notifications of completed scans.
